## Project Structure
Here’s what’s happening in simple terms:
You see a sentence on the screen.
You have 30 seconds to type that sentence as fast and as correctly as you can.
The game counts how many words you type (that’s your speed, called WPM — words per minute).
It also checks how many letters match the original sentence (that’s your accuracy).
When the time is up, it shows your score.
You can start again or get a new sentence.
It’s like a stopwatch + spelling checker + scoreboard, all in one.
